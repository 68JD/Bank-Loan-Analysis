# 🏦 Bank Loan Analytics Project
This project focuses on analyzing bank loan data to derive actionable insights and support decision-making processes. The project is structured around three key tools: Excel, Power BI, and MySQL, each playing a critical role in different phases of the analysis.

Key Components:

🧹 Data Cleaning:
Utilizing Excel and MySQL, we meticulously cleaned and prepared the dataset to ensure accuracy and reliability in subsequent analyses. This phase involved handling missing values, removing duplicates, and standardizing data formats.

📊 Data Visualization:
Power BI was used to transform the cleaned data into insightful visualizations. These visualizations help in identifying trends, patterns, and outliers, providing a clear understanding of the data.

📈 Dashboards:
Interactive dashboards were created in Power BI, allowing stakeholders to explore the data dynamically. These dashboards offer a comprehensive view of key metrics and trends, making it easier to monitor performance and make informed decisions.

📋 KPIs in MySQL:
Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) were calculated using MySQL, providing a quantifiable measure of the bank’s loan performance. These KPIs are crucial for assessing the effectiveness of loan strategies and identifying areas for improvement.
